“Choice” often refers to reproductive rights, but women are fighting more than one important battle for choice -- we’re fighting for the ability to choose to dedicate ourselves to our professional and personal aspirations while still being able to support our families. In the United States, this issue transcends class, race, and ethnicity, and as is too often the case, the further down the socioeconomic spectrum one moves, the more restrictive the constraints of this choice become and the harsher its effects.

The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 expanded a woman’s ability to seek compensation for pay discrimination- yet, on average, women still make 77 cents to the white, non-Hispanic man’s dollar. Black and hispanic women fare even worse, making 64 cents and 56 cents to the dollar, respectively. This wage gap grows exponentially as a woman’s career advances, and has lasting  effects on her entire family’s outcomes.

As if to add insult to the injury of pay discrimination, women are expected to juggle childcare, work, and household responsibilities without policies to support them in doing so. Women are told to ‘lean in’, to behave like men and to adopt male tendencies for success (and are then often labeled as “too aggressive”), as if a woman’s inherent strengths were insufficient, and as if the majority of women weren’t “leaning in” already.  

For more than twenty years, women have been enrolling in and graduating from college at higher rates than men. Yet, they still make up the minority of leadership positions in business and in government. Less than 20% of Fortune 500 board members are women and less than [4% of the top 200 law firms have female firm-wide managing partners](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/on-leadership/wp/2014/02/18/large-law-firms-are-failing-women-lawyers/). All this, despite the fact that women’s skills, interests, and communication styles lead [gender-balanced corporate boards to outperform predominantly male boards](http://www.theglasshammer.com/news/2013/01/31/how-do-women-improve-board-performance-let-us-count-the-ways/). Workplace gender discrimination, outdated perceptions of a woman’s role, and inadequate support in motherhood are to blame. Women in the working world are expected to do the office “[housework](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/opinion/sunday/sheryl-sandberg-and-adam-grant-on-women-doing-office-housework.html),” such as note-taking and [speak less](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/opinion/sunday/speaking-while-female.html) than their male colleagues (and are penalized when they don’t!).

Because of the high costs of childcare ([about $12k per child annually](http://www.naccrra.org/news-room/press-releases/2014/12/child-care-costs-unaffordable-for-most)), many women either leave the workforce to care for their children or work excessive hours to afford childcare. For many women, leaving work is not an option either because of their income constraints or the work requirements required for social safety net programs. Consequently, many women have little time to actually spend with their children and, as a result, [carry with them an extraordinary sense of guilt and pressure.](http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/02/i-am-the-slacker-parent.html) The cost of childcare manifests itself doubly- as an interruption in a woman’s career and as an economic cost to employers in the form of a high turnover rate and loss of valuable employees.

**We argue that it is not up to women to do the leaning in. It is our society, our government, and our men that need to start leaning in, just as women have done for decades. Paid parental leave (for both mothers and fathers!), subsidized childcare, fair pay acts with teeth, and the enforcement of penalties for pregnancy discrimination are all crucial to the wellbeing of women and to the economic advancement of our country. Only with these policies and an open dialogue about the difficulties all women face in the workplace, can we achieve gender parity.**

###Equal Pay
*   Women make 77 cents to the dollar, compared to white non-Hispanic men
*   A typical woman who worked full time, year round would lose $464,320 in a 40-year period due to the wage gap
*   Mothers who work full time, year round typically have lower earnings than fathers ($38,000 compared to $55,000), meaning mothers only make 69 cents for every dollar paid to fathers
*   The amount a woman loses to the pay gap could feed a family of four for 37 years
