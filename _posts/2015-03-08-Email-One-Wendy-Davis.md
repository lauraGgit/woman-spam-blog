Happy International Women's Day!

So what inspired us to WomanSpam you? It’s a pattern we’ve noticed over the past two years spent as students at GSPP -- a pattern where **women are outside the mainstream conversation at GSPP and less visible than our male counterparts**, even though we outnumber them.

Last Wednesday, Women in Public Policy co-hosted former State Senator Wendy Davis -- famed for her 11-hour filibuster in 2013 to protect women’s reproductive autonomy in Texas. Senator Davis is a political figure who is by every estimation a Shero. Following the event, a group of us were excitedly talking about Senator Davis’s eloquence and political acuity. Yet, we couldn’t help but notice one thing: at a GSPP event, hosted by a popular student group, featuring an important legislator and politician, only a handful of our male colleagues showed up.

We found this interesting, given that Senator Davis was exigent in her Q&A about one thing: **we need men to understand that issues like equal pay, reproductive health, and child care should not matter only to women.** Senator Davis and other female politicians are not fighting for these issues because they are “women’s issues.” She, and they, fight for these issues because they will make all of us better off -- and they are the right policies to fight for if you believe that women deserve the same kind of opportunities that men already have.

Senator Davis spent a significant portion of her talk explaining how UC Berkeley School of Law Professor Ian Haney Lopez, who delivered a talk on Thursday on the other side of campus, has hit the nail on the head in calling out the “dog whistle politics” of public leaders. These leaders use coded racial language (e.g., the “welfare queen”) that preys on people’s fear of differences and “the other,” in order to manipulate voters and maintain control--even if it means getting voters to elect leaders who will not look out for their interests once in office. The same dog whistle politics, Senator Davis says, are ever-present when it comes to the politics and language surrounding gender-related issues, such as reproductive rights. 


So why were so few men in the audience with us that day? Have dog whistle politics gotten the better of even the educated, thoughtful, and progressive men of GSPP? 

We wouldn’t read too much into this except that this isn’t the only instance where women have been outside of the mainstream conversation at GSPP and not as visible as our male counterparts. 

**Many of us**--not just women, we must add, but also a small handful of male students and faculty as well-- **have noted the critical lack of female voices heard at GSPP.** Those of us who have noticed it can’t help but see it everywhere: from the invited guest speakers and lecturers (including the past two years’ Stop the Clock events) to the framed photos on the walls of Room 105 to the emails circulated on the community listservs. 

We do not believe this lack of female voices and presence at GSPP is intentional, nor do we believe that our classmates, faculty, or the administration are acting in any way maliciously.

But we do want to call it out so that we can all acknowledge it, discuss it, address it, and become better members of the GSPP community for it. In the same way that Blacks in Public Policy has urged us to call out and eradicate racism because black lives matter to GSPP, in the same way that Students of Color in Public Policy leads us in thoughtful and challenging conversations each year during their annual symposium, and in the same way that so many student initiatives encourage us to examine more critically the world around us and to think more deeply about our own biases, we hope to elevate the conversation about gender equity at GSPP.

We look forward to sharing more facts and perspectives with you throughout the week and welcome a thoughtful dialogue on these critical issues of women’s equality.

If you have made it to the end of this email, you are our S/hero. 

Until next time,
