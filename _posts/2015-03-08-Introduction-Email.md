Dear GSPP:

Today, as many of you know, is **International Women’s Day**. We would like to ask for five minutes of your time today and each day of this coming week to read what we have lovingly termed our #WomanSpamming email series, covering important issues for us as GSPP students, women, and future policymakers. 

We know you are busy, overwhelmed, and that you already receive too many emails every day. So, while you are free to delete our emails at will, **we feel that women policymakers and women’s issues are often ignored or minimized at GSPP -- and we hope you can make a show of solidarity each day this week by choosing to read on.**

<!--more-->

To make it even harder for you to evade us on our quest to place women front and center in your consciousness this week, **we will be constructing a Wall of Women Sheroes at GSPP**-- hopefully with your help! 

Tomorrow (Monday) from 12-1pm we will be in the living room with some supplies for you to add a Shero of your choice onto our wall.

We’ve also created this digital [Wall of Sheroes](http://womanspamming.com/) -- and you can even [add your own](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xLH5V66pBxx404hKcg98B1_axM0GPdnZZo8IUMmBWKU/edit)!

Stay tuned for #WomanSpamming email number one...

Yours in celebration,

The Coalition of Women Spammers:
